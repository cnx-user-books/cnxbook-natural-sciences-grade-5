        <para id="id26294237">One gets natural and artificial polymers. Proteins, which any living body needs to grow, are an example of a natural polymer. Synthetic polymers were first invented about 100 years ago. They were very scarce and expensive then. Synthetic polymers can be divided into two groups: fibres and plastic. We are going to look mainly at plastic.</para>
